First Source Hackathon

This project is a Telegram bot which uses Divar's recently published dataset to answer user's queries about the data.
https://research.cafebazaar.ir/visage/divar_datasets/

There are 6 major categories,
1. Vehicles
2. Electronic devices
3. Businesses
4. For the home
5. Personal
6. Leisure & Hobbies

At each step user is asked some question about some feature of the data and this helps us filter the result to the point there are no more features to ask user about them.
At the end 5 of the advertisments that match users's queries are shown to him/her.
